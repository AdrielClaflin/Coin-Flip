                My hobbies are: animating, coding, playing the piano, violin and games. Including Dungeons and Dragons, Starcraft, League of Legends, Super Smash Bros, and Overwatch. 
                Indeed i'm a quite dork, who always plays a bard in d&d just so he can play his violin in front of people.

            <p>
                I spend most of my time creating little personal projects or gaming. Another hobby of mine is playing disc golf.
                I joined the GIMM program because of the portfolio we create throughout the major. I figured having proof that I can do what my piece of paper says I can do is a good way to go about things.
                Additionally, GIMM teaches skills that are valuable to what I think I want to do in life.
