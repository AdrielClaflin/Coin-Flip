	<p>I'm 19, am native to Idaho and am currently a sophomore at Boise State University. I'm part of the GIMM program, and
		love to draw and read. I do both traditional painting and digital art, but I prefer digital drawing. I play a lot of video games, my favorite genre being action JRPG's.
 </p>
	<p>I have a few projects I'd like to do for GIMM and for myself during my time in GIMM. These include starting to draft/draw a comic, create a game, and perhaps dabble into making music as well.
