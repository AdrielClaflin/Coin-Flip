            Welcome to my page. Yes, that is my real first name. The story behind that is that there was this NASCAR driver back in the day named Cale Yarborough,
            so my parents decided to name me after him.

            I was born here in Boise in August of 1997, but my family moved to Nampa shortly after. That is where I lived until about 2015, when we finally moved back to Boise.

            My biggest hobby is definitely gaming of a few different sorts, but I also play disc golf from time to time. It's difficult, but not quite as much as regular golf.
            I find it very relaxing to play if I don't take it too seriously.

            I decided to come to GIMM because it encompasses many of the things I enjoy, so I'm hoping to find something I think I can do as a career. The portfolio and
            degree don't hurt, either.
