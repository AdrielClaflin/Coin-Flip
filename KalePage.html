    <p>
        I spend most of my time creating little personal projects or gaming. Another hobby of mine is playing disc golf.
        I joined the GIMM program because of the portfolio we create throughout the major. I figured having proof that I can do what my piece of paper says I can do is a good way to go about things.
        Additionally, GIMM teaches skills that are valuable to what I think I want to do in life.
