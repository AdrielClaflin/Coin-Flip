		<h1>Adriel Claflin</h1>
		<p>I am an aspiring concept artist, majoring in game design and minoring in visual art. While my main mediums of creativity are photoshop and copic markers, I’m proficient in video editing and several coding languages.</p>

        <p>My other interests include dungeons and dragons, star wars, art history (particularly bronze age through medieval), martial arts,s̶̴͘͘͟u̡m̛m̴̴̷̧o̡͢n͘̕į̡͟ǹ̨ǵ̸̷̕ ̸͢͠t̢̕ḩ̀e͡͏͡ ͜҉͢҉à̷l͝͞͞l̴͜͞ ̷҉͠͠ć̶͟͝o̢͝͞ǹ̵́͘s̀̀u̸͜m̡҉i̸͏̕n̵̶̴̡ǵ̨̕͜ ̵͝h͘͝͡u̧͝n̶̶͟͟ǵ̸̵̀e̵̷҉҉r̨̀ŗ̗̠̝̜, costume and prop making, super heroes, and many flavors of science fantasy.</p>

        <p>I obtianed my primary media arts education at Meridian Technical Chater High School where I learned the ins and outs of the adobe suite, and worked with the fundementals of computer based design. Now I'm refining my skills at Boise State University through the GIMM program as well as the Visual Arts program. I've been doing art for upwards of eight years now, and hope to continue that streak well into the future.</p>
